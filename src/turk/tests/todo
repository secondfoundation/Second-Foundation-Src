TESTS WE SHOULD ADD:
--------------------------

- need more global tests
  in particular, need a global verification test
  where we provide a set of known cards (ideally, with a complicated outcome, like a side pot)
  and can run to ensure we are running the 'game of poker' completely deterministically correct
