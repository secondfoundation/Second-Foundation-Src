# ----------------------------------------
# Preparing your development environment: 
# ----------------------------------------
Easy_install is recommended to manage the packages necessary to run the
code. Easy_install is available for Mac, Windows and Linux. 

Once easy_install is available, the required packages can be installed using: 

easy_install numpy 
easy_install matplotlib
easy_install emcee

The code was intended to be run using python 2.X

# ----------------------------------------
# Editing the files
# ----------------------------------------

You will require three files, 'prior.py', 'likelihood.py' and 'channel.py'. 
Please ensure these files are all located within the same directory. 

You should only need to edit the 'prior.py' and 'likelihood.py' files. 
The channel.py file is a driver utility for performing a Bayesian parameter estimation.
This driver uses the python 'emcee' (http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/) library which is an 
implementation of Goodman and Weareâ€™s affine invariant MCMC sampling technique 
(http://msp.org/camcos/2010/5-1/p04.xhtml). 

# ----------------------------------------
# Running the code
# ----------------------------------------

You can run the routine from the command line as:

python channel.py

This should generate several pdf plots in your local directory.
